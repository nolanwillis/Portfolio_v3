Blockopoly:
A multiplayer monopoly clone built using Unreal Engine and C++. Allows multiple players to connect over LAN or over Steam. Includes classic Monopoly functionality, such as: buying/selling properties, 
chance/chest cards, upgrading properties, trading properties and going to jail. Covers topics such as replication, RPC calls, sessions, event driven UI, delegates and the Steam online-subsystem.

The demo was recording using two simulated instances on one machine. And shows most of the functionality talked about above. 

Animation System: 
This is a non-skinned animation system built for a prototype game engine I've been working on throughout multiple courses at DePaul. It uses linear and spherical-linear interpolation to calculate bone 
transforms between keyframes, a PCS tree to establish hierarchical relationships among bones, and a conversion tool that generates the necessary keyframe data from .glb files.

The demo shows 5 robot chickens performing various animations and animation operations, like swapping animations, reversing them, slowing them down, and  speeding them up.
